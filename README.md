# EmployeeManagementSystem
An employee management web app and api programmed in C# with an adminlte template, using the ASP.Net core framework and MicrsoftSQL server. 

# Core Web App - EmployeeManagement
The core web app for the employee management system. Programmed with a C# back-end, and AdminLTE 3.2.0 front-end (LICENSE(s) included in the core web app file). The main directories, which I have orgnaized using clean architecture, which demonstrate my skills in back-end technologies are as follows:
      Application
      Core
      Infrastructure
      Presentation

# API - EmployeeManagement
The API for the employee management system has been pushed. In order to test, the default connection string in appsettings.json needs to be altered. For first time test, a migration needs to be added, and the database needs to be updated.
Commands are: 
      add-migration
      update-database

Pictures and Video Demo coming soon!
